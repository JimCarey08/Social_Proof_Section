## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn more about grid and flexbox, especially in responsive design. I think i'm getting better in css, of course thats a lot to learn, but one challenge at a time. I'm understanding more about grid-area, grid-templates-area (kinda).

### Continued development

I think theres a lot to improve in responsive design and grid. Also optimize the mobile layout to make the desktop easier using grid and flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - This helped me to understand flexbox and values for flex properties.
- [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com) - This helped me to understand GRID and values for grid properties.
